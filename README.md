# QuizGame-RG-C-Project
A command line Quiz Game that's very detailed <br>
This is my first year project. It was wrote in C
# Target:
1. All of the process is wrote in the Source file only which is terrible in term of Coding, so dividing it is a great idea<br>
2. There are still some bugs for each process so it should be recheck and recode<br>
3. The code can be minimized using better algorithm<br>
# Plan:
1. U should write a flowchart for your own understanding and how most of the global variable works  
2. Try to write it again from scratch or if you want to copy your own code make sure you understand what are you writing
3. After finished developing try to test for all possible case for bugs
